    <h1>
        =>What are the differences between var, let and const ?
    </h1>
    <h3>So var, let and const are keywords used to declare and initialize variables. Variables are basically container
        used to store any type of data. The basic difference between var, let and const is with <b>var</b> keyword we
        can
        re-declare and re-initialise same variable again and again. Ex- <br>var a=20;<br>var a=100;<br>var
        a=1000;<br><br>
        But with <b>let</b> we can declare a variable only once and not again and again but we re-assign the same
        variable
        again and again.Ex- <br>let a = 20;<br>a = 100;<br>a = 1000;<br><br>And in <b>const</b> we can declare and
        assign
        the value
        only once. We cannot re-declare and re-assign the variable. Also in const we have to initialize the variable and
        declare the variable in the same line. Ex-<br>const a = 100;

    <h1>
        =>What are the differences between null and undefined and where to use what?
    </h1>
    <h3>In javascript, both undefined and null represent the absence of a meaningful value, but they are used in
        slightly different contexts. <br>Undefined - When a variable is declared but not initialized and if we try to
        console the variable it will return undefined. For ex- <br> let a; <br>console.log(a); //it will return
        undefined. <br><br>Null - It is an assignment used to represent the absence of any value.It is done explicitly
        to indicate the variable should have no value. It is done for future like if we want to store some value in it
        by running some other code. <br>let a = null;

        =>What are the uses of prompt in javascript ?
    </h1>
    <h3>Prompt() method is used to display a dialog box with an optional message prompting the user to input some text.
        It is often used if the user wants to input a value before entering a page. It shows in the starting when
        browser loads the page. It return a string containing the text enterd by the user, or null. <br>Syntax-
        prompt(message, default); <br>message - It is a string of text to display to the user. <br>default - it is a
        string containing the default value displayed in the text field. <br>Ex- let a = prompt("Enter a value");

    <h1>
        =>Why javascript is a dynamic language? Write the code for all data types ?
    </h1>
    <h3>
        javascript is dynamic bacause the language is scarily flexible. Unlike other programming languages in javascript
        we don't have to assign a datatype to a variable , variables are not strictly integers, floats, booleans ,
        strings or null. In javascript we can again and again give different datatypes to the same variable. For ex-
        <br> let a = 6; //integer typedata <br>a = "javascript" //string datatype <br>a = false //boolean datatype.
        <br>Secondly in other programming languages compiler will review the source code and scan for errors prior to
        executing the code, but in javascript it will execute the code and locate the errors during runtime only. Like
        javascript runs code after every line and stops when you get an error. This helps programmers to find bugs and
        errors easily while writing the code and saves a lot of time. These things makes javascript dynamic in nature.
        <br>So basically there are two type of datatypes present in Javascript. 1. Primitive Data Type 2. Non-primitive
        Data Type. <br>
        Primitive Datatype consist of 5 different data type mainly- 1. Number----let a = 23; <br> 2. String----let a =
        "I am a string"<br> 3. Boolean-----let a = true/false; <br>4. Undefined----let a; <br> 5. Null----let a = null;
        <br>Non-primitive datatype consist of 3 different data type named- 1. Object---{key : value} <br> 2.
        Array----[23, 45, 86] <br>3. Function---function a(){}

    </h1>
    <h3>
        JavaScript operators operate the operands, these are symbols that are used to manipulate a certain value or
        operand. Operators are used to performing specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. <br>In
        JavaScript, operators are used to compare values, perform arithmetic operations, etc <br><br>JavaScript
        Operators: There are various operators supported by JavaScript. <br>JavaScript Arithmetic Operators-----+, -, %,

        !==, >, <,>=, <= <br>JavaScript Logical Operators----&&, ||, ! <br>JavaScript Ternary Operators---? ex- y = ? A:

    </h1>
    <h3>
        A binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands and manipulates them to return a result..
        <br>Binary operators are presented in the form: Operand1 Operator Operand2<br><br>Some common binary operators
        in computing include: <br>
        Equal (==) <br>Not equal (!=) <br>Less than (<) <br>Greater than (>) <br>Greater than or equal to (>=) <br>Less

    <h1>
        =>Explain the Pre-increment and Post-increment in JavaScript.
    </h1>
    <h3>
        The increment(++) operator increments i.e adds one to its operands and returns the value before or after the
        increment, depending on where the operator is placed. <br><br> Post-increment--In this case, operator is placed
        after operand(x++), the increment operator increments and returns the value before incrementing. Ex- <br>let x =
        3;<br>
        let y = x++; <br>console.log(x) //it will give output 4 <br>console.log(y) //it will give output 3<br><br>
        Pre-increment--In this case, operator is placed before operand(++x), the increment operator increments and
        returns the value after incrementing. Ex- <br>let x = 3;<br>
        let y = ++x; <br>console.log(x) //it will give output 4 <br>console.log(y) //it will give output 4.
    </h3>
    <h1>
        =>Difference between "==" and "===" operators.
    </h1>
    <h3>
        These are comparison operators. They are used to compare two operands. <br>In Javascript, the ‘==’ operator is
        also known as the loose equality operator which is mainly used to compare two values on both sides and then
        return true or false. Ex- <br>console.log(21 == 21); //true <br>console.log(21 == '21'); //true
        <br>console.log('food is love'=='food is love'); //true <br>console.log(21 == 32); //false <br>console.log(21 ==
        '32'); //false <br><br>JavaScript ‘===’ operator, also known as strict equality operator, it compares both the
        value and the type which is why the name “strict equality”. Ex- <br>console.log('hello world' === 'hello
        world'); //true <br>console.log(true === true); //true <br>console.log(5 === 5); //true <br>console.log(true ===
        1); //false <br>console.log(true === 'true'); //false <br>console.log(5 === '5'); //false.
